        <h1>WEB DESIGN</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Web design</b> refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user experience aspects of
            website development rather than
            software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however,
            since the mid-2010s,
            design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important.

            A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content.
        <ul>
            <li> Appearance relates to the colors, typography, and images used.</li>
            <li>Layout refers to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use,
                aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.</li>
            <li> A well-designed website is simple and communicates clearly to avoid confusing users. It wins and
                fosters the
                target audience's trust, removing as many potential points of user frustration as possible.</li>
        </ul>
