        <p>
            <b>Web development</b>, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating,
            building, and maintaining websites
            and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web
            programming, and database management.
        </p>
        <p>
            The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup
            Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.
            There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that
            would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code.
